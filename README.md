## Theme Chosen For The **Smart Odisha Hackathon 2022** - **Agriculture**

## Problem Statement :-
  - Delay in settling of crop insurance claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana
  - Rejection of crop insurance claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana

## Problem Description :-
 - The Government of Odisha has enrolled multiple farmers across the state under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) this year. The number of enrollments has been increasing every year and the Government hopes to reach more farmers in a short time. 

 - Even though the scheme has been designed to be pro-farmer, there have been operational issues in the field. One such challenging problem is the delayed settlement of insurance claims and their rejection by insurance companies. Insurance companies are yet to clear almost 33 percent of estimated claims to the framers who come under the PMFBY.  Due to these issues the state has witnessed farmer agitations about the lack of clarity in the settlement and disbursement of insurance claims. 

## Our Approach ü§î:-
  - Our goal was to provide a unified platform powerful enough to efficiently manage and display all the relevant insurance related claims on the palms of a farmer.
 It should be simple enough for the end user and be enough functional enough to implement the below points üòÆ‚Äçüí®
 - We started building a UI/UX using a poppular Android framework Flutter and for backend part Nodejs,MongoDB , expressJS , firebase to handle the requests smartlyüòè
 - Firstly was building a digitised tracking system that updated with the central govt database to track a insurance claim . It was mainly comparing from databases of the govt , bank and the insurance company.

 - We implemented a CNN Model to detect plant-based diseases . Fully integrated into the flutter app.Now a Farmer now can click a photo and recieve instant results.

 - We also implemented geolocation-based weather collecting data feature.If a farmer claims insurance for heavy rains or drought the insurance company can verify the 
 same from the picture supplied by the farmer while filing a complaint.

 - Blockchain payment is used to pay the premium . We thought if a insurance reasons that a farmer is behind on the premium , the authenticity of such claims can be verified by the immutability of blockchain ledgers maintained on the blockchain network.

 - There might be a case when a farmer may defraud for a insurance claim , keeping this in the mind we came with a solution to include geolocation of the photo clicked live on the site . Then insurance company can check the location from their database and neccessary actions.This ensures that there is a lesser chance for corruption


- For calculating yeild of land using another ML Model taking parameters of Air Temperature , Avearage Rainfall , Pesticide and Croptype.

- By providing the above mentioned solutions a farmerv gets payment digitally and in a faster manner and reuces delay in claim process.For a insurance company can fasten the process of verification.

- For the Government , stress is reduced by preventing agitations by farmers on not receiving claimed money or delay in the process of getting in the insurance.
